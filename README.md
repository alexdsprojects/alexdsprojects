## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### ðŸ”­ I am a Certified Junior Data Scientist based in Canada, currently working as a freelancer after completing an intensive Data Science Bootcamp. With 15+ years of experience leading B2B/B2C business strategies, I bring a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset that now fuels my passion for data.

#### ðŸ‘¯ My focus is on leveraging Python, SQL, and machine learning to transform raw data into actionable insights that drive business impact. I am actively seeking a full-time opportunity to collaborate with a forward-thinking company where I can contribute to data-driven decision making while continuing to grow as a professional.
